# X-Team 117 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
- Read the problem statement, analyze the work to be done, and divide it into a number of sub-tasks.
- Depending on the complexity of each sub-task to be completed, the team members will take turns accordingly and complete the tasks.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks



## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us



## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed



## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
