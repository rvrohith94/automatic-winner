# X-Team 117 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
- Read the problem statement, analyze the work to be done, and divide it into a number of sub-tasks.
- Depending on the complexity of each sub-task to be completed, the team members will discuss first and then take turns accordingly and complete the tasks.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
- Hold a team discussion and set an agreeable early deadline for the work to be completed.
- Set individual deadlines for the tasks to be completed by each team member.
- Decide upon a common communication time daily and then have a mini-meeting where each team member will convey the status of the progress   of the task assigned to them.
- In case any team member anticipates that they will not be able to participate in the daily mini-meeting, then they will communicate the   same ahead of time to the rest of the team without fail. Team leader to follow-up further in case that doesn't happen.
