# X-Team 117 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
- Read the problem statement, analyze the work to be done, and divide it into a number of sub-tasks.
- Depending on the complexity of each sub-task to be completed, the team members will discuss first and then take turns accordingly and complete the tasks.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
- Hold a team discussion and set an agreeable early deadline for the work to be completed.
- Set individual deadlines for the tasks to be completed by each team member.
- Decide upon a common communication time daily and then have a mini-meeting where each team member will convey the status of the progress   of the task assigned to them.
- In case any team member anticipates that they will not be able to participate in the daily mini-meeting, then they will communicate     the same ahead of time to the rest of the team without fail. Team leader to follow-up further in case that doesn't happen.

## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
- Allocate the last 10-15 minutes of the daily mini-meetings solely for the purpose of any technical or non-technical                     difficulties/blockers faced by the team members with regards to completing their assigned tasks.
- Create and maintain a shared social media chat group between the team members (for example: Slack). Dedicate a channel exclusively for   the blockers faced by team members.
- Team members need not wait till the daily mini-meeting to convey the difficulties they are facing while completing tasks. They can       simply update the blocker chat channel with their issues and if any other team member happens to see that, then they may volunteer to   help their teammate.
- All the unresolved blockers posted by team members will be discussed in the daily mini-meetings. Any team member with required           technical expertise is to guide and help in resolving the blockers. Otherwise a brain-storming session may follow where the team         collectively finds out ways to resolve the issue.
